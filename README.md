Upload 29.11.2019:
The purpose of this project is setting a backup for the python coding course.
Current relevant packages: numpy pandas matplotlib.pyplot scipy.stats 
In the whole semester we will have 6 problem sets, covering topics in finance:
### Problem Set 1: 
Calculating the time-series asset returns (equity/bond), annual/10-years sharp ratio, the P&L possibility in equity investment from 1999 to 2019.
### Problem Set 2:
Build first Markowitz portfolios, identify the minimum variance portfolio, the tangency portfolio and the complete efficient frontier.
### Problem Set 3:
Estimate the CAPM and make predictions for the expected return of a stock based on the CAPM and the regarding Security Market Line.
Generalize to a multi-factor model and explain portfolio returns with the 3 Fama-French factors.
### Problem Set 4:
Estimate an ARMA(1, 1) model to predict factor returns, then create return forecasts and simulate the model to obtain the model-implied distribution of factor returns.
### Problem Set 5:
Estimate an AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model to predict factor returns and their volatility. Compare the volatility forecast
of the GARCH model with the vol forecast of a simpler ARCH(1) model.
